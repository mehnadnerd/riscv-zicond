[[Zicond]]
== Zicond proposed specification

The "Conditional" operations extension provides a simple solution that provides most of the benefit and all of the flexibility one would desire to support conditional arithmetic and conditional-select/move operations, while remaining true to the RISC-V design philosophy.
The instructions follow the format for R-type instructions with 3 operands (i.e., 2 source operands and 1 destination operand).
Using these instructions, branchless sequences can be implemented (typically in two-instruction sequences) without the need for instruction fusion, special provisions during the decoding of architectural instructions, or other microarchitectural provisions.

The following instructions comprise the Zicond extension:

|czero.nez _rd_, _rs1_, _rs2_
|<<#insns-czero-nez>>

[NOTE]
====
Architecture Comment: defining additional comparisons, in addition to equal-to-zero and not-equal-to-zero, does not offer a benefit due to the lack of immediates or an additional register operand that the comparison takes place against. 
====

Based on these two instructions, synthetic instructions (i.e., short instruction sequences) for the following *conditional arithmetic* operations are supported:

* conditional add, if zero
* conditional add, if non-zero
* conditional subtract, if zero
* conditional subtract, if non-zero
* conditional bitwise-and, if zero
* conditional bitwise-and, if non-zero
* conditional bitwise-or, if zero
* conditional bitwise-or, if non-zero
* conditional bitwise-xor, if zero
* conditional bitwise-xor, if non-zero

Additionally, the following *conditional select* instructions are supported:

* conditional-select, if zero
* conditional-select, if non-zero

More complex conditions, such as comparisons against immediates, registers, single-bit tests, comparisons against ranges, etc. can be realized by composing these new instructions with existing instructions.

[#insns-czero-eqz,reftext="Conditional zero, if condition is equal to zero"]
=== czero.eqz

Synopsis::
Moves zero to a register _rd_, if the condition _rs2_ is equal to zero, otherwise moves _rs1_ to _rd_.

Mnemonic::
czero.eqz _rd_, _rs1_, _rs2_

Encoding::
[wavedrom, , svg]
....
{reg:[
    { bits:  7, name: 0x33, attr: ['OP'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rd' },
    { bits:  3, name: 0x5, attr: ['CZERO.EQZ']},
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs1', attr: ['value'] },
    { bits:  5, name: 'rs2', attr: ['condition'] },
    { bits:  7, name: 0x7, attr: ['CZERO'] },
]}
....

Description::
This instruction behaves as if there is a conditional branch dependent on _rs2_ being equal to zero, wherein it branches to code that writes a 0 into _rd_ when the equivalence is true, and otherwise falls through to code that moves _rs1_ into _rd_.
Accordingly, the syntactic dependency on _rs1_ is only propagated when the condition is false.
This instruction has a control dependency on _rs2_, rather than a data dependency.
Furthermore, this instruction's timing is independent of the data value of _rs1_ if the Zkt extension is implemented. +

In effect, if the value of register _rs2_ is zero, place 0 (zero) into the register _rd_; otherwise, place the value of register _rs1_ into _rd_.

[NOTE]
====
These branch-based semantics do not prevent implementing this instruction as a simple select (e.g., "(rs2==0) ? 0 : rs1").
Instead, they allow for more sophisticated implementations where a zero result can be returned when the condition (rs2==0) is true without waiting for _rs1_ to be available.
Furthermore, implementations can predict the condition just as they might for branches.

=== Alternative sequences with data-invariant timing

The definition of `czero.eqz` and `czero.nez` does not generally guarantee data-invariant timing (although it guarantees independence of the value of one of its arguments, if the Zkt extension is implemented).

However, sequences using instructions covered by Zkt are available to express the same semantics as for the `czero.eqz` and `czero.nez` instructions:

[%header,cols="2,.^4l"]
|===
|Zicond instruction
|Alternative sequence with data-invariant timing

|`czero.eqz rd, rs1, rs2`
|snez rtmp, rs2
neg  rtmp, rtmp
and  rd, rtmp, rs1

|`czero.nez rd, rs1, rs2`
|seqz rtmp, rs2
neg  rtmp, rtmp
and  rd, rtmp, rs1
